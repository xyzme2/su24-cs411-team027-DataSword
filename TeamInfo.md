## Project Summary

Using the entire Yu-Gi-Oh! Card pool as one of our data sources, we want to evaluate the valid targets for the activation of “Small World”, given a specific card pool. Small World is a card that requires choosing a card from the deck that has exactly one of a set of identifiers and adding to your hand another card that has identifiers based on that card. “Small World” is a card that perplexes many players of Yu-Gi-Oh!, so some application that simplifies the process would be useful. 

A simple application to give targets of “Small World” from a given hand or deck would give more simplicity. A connection to a database of card art could aid in the visual representation of cards.
